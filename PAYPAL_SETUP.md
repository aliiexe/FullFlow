# PayPal Payment Setup Guide

## Quick Fix for "about:blank" Issue

The PayPal payment getting stuck on `about:blank` page has been fixed by:

1. **Removed redirect URLs** from PayPal order creation
2. **Improved error handling** in all PayPal endpoints
3. **Added payment data saving** functionality
4. **Enhanced logging** for better debugging

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# PayPal Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id_here
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_paypal_secret_here
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=your_paypal_webhook_id_here

# Clerk Configuration (if using)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key_here
```

## PayPal Sandbox Setup

1. Go to [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/)
2. Create a new app or use existing one
3. Get your Client ID and Secret from the app settings
4. Use Sandbox credentials for testing

## Testing the Payment Flow

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to your pricing page
3. Select services and click PayPal button
4. Complete payment in PayPal sandbox
5. Should redirect to success page with order details

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Redirect URLs
- PayPal order creation no longer includes `return_url` and `cancel_url`
- This prevents the `about:blank` page issue
- PayPal SDK handles redirects automatically

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added credential validation
- Better error messages and logging
- Proper error responses to client

### 3. Payment Data Saving
- Created `/api/payment/save-payment` endpoint
- Payment data is now saved after successful capture
- Includes all relevant payment details

### 4. Improved Client-Side Flow
- Better error handling in PayPal buttons
- Success message before redirect
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## Troubleshooting

If payments still don't work:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure PayPal credentials are set
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages in browser console
3. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API calls are successful
4. **Test with Sandbox**: Use PayPal sandbox for testing

## Next Steps

1. Set up your PayPal credentials in `.env.local`
2. Test the payment flow
3. Implement database integration in `/api/payment/save-payment`
4. Set up webhooks for production
